1. Understand the Requirements:
    - Implement a bowling scorecard that can calculate the score of a game for one player.
    - The scorecard should handle strikes, spares, and regualr rolls.
    - Implement using TDD.

2. Design the Solution:
    - Create a 'Scorecard' class.
    - Implement methods for adding frames and calculating scores.
    - Handle obvious special cases (spares and strikes).

3. Write Tests:
    - Start with simple tests for calculating scores and adding frames.
    - Add tests for handling strikes and spares.
    - Ensure tests cover all edge cases (e.g., 10th frame rules).

4. Implement the Solution:
    - Implement the 'Scorecard' class and its methods.
    - Run tests after each implementation to ensure correctness.

5. Refactor and Optimise (Nice to Have):
    - Ensure code is clean and follows JS conventions.
    - Optimise the code for efficiency and readability.

IMPLEMENTATION (TICK THESE LATER)

1. Create the Initial Project Structure:
    - Set up a new directory for the project.
    - Initialise a Node.js project and install the necessary dependencies (e.g., Jest for testing).

2. Create the 'Scorecard' Class:
    - Implement methods like 'addFrame' and 'calculateScore'.

3. Write Tests:
    - Create a test file and write initial tests for the 'Scorecard' class.

4. Implement and Test Incrementally:
    - Implement the basic functionality and run tests.
    - Gradually add more functionality and corresponding tests.
